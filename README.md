### Project summary
Castle Mountain Coffee Company is an idea that has its roots in the rockies. It is Alberta's response to the third wave coffee trend. Through these series of articles, we hope to inform coffee fans and novices that there is more to coffee than bitterness and obvious flavours. We strive to share an experience that starts with the beans, all the way to foam art.
